# HW2:  Pandas

## Overview

This homework contents 4 tasks for working with pandas.

1. Drawing of histogram for ACTG according to position.
1. Filtering data frame according to task.
1. Small EDA of Pokemon dataset.
1. Working with rrna-annotation and alignment.

Code containts in hw2_pandas.ipynb and hw2_pandas.py

## Requirements

Code was tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Python 3.8.10.
Necessary modules are listed in requirements.txt file.
To intstall them need to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Problems

According to the task, it as necessary to save the result in the form of a Jupiter notebook and in the form of a Python script. The difficulty with this requirement is that the Python code saved by Jupiter Notebook does not pass Flake check.
And Flake is used in Github to check each commit.

So after each correction of python code according to Flake requirements, I have to correct Jupyter notebook as well, and it really took a lot of time! So I'm not sure why we need  to provide the results in the form of two synchronized Jupiter and Python files, as it looks like time-consuming and pointless task at this point.
